  <h1>EDUCATION</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>BSc Chemistry (Debrecen - 2020 - 2024)</h2>
  <div>
  <h3>University Of Debrecen</h3>
  <div>
  <ul>
    <li>Focused on advanced chemical analysis and research methodologies</li>
    <li>Focused on core chemistry courses, including general, organic, and inorganic chemistry, as well as
physical chemistry. The curriculum involved hands-on laboratory work, analytical techniques, and
may include mathematics and physics components. It also offered me with specialized areas like
biochemistry or environmental chemistry, and research projects</li>
    <li>Overall GPA: 4.34 out of 5</li>
    <li>Conducted thesis research on 'Nickel complexes of peptides containing histidine in the third
position'
, focusing on the reversibility of formation of nickel(II) complexes and their stability in
various conditions. Utilized pH-potentiometric, UV-vis, and CD spectroscopic measurements to
investigate chemical properties and interactions, contributing to the field of metal-peptide
chemistry</li>
  </ul></div></div>
<div>
 <h3>Laboratory Experience</h3> 
 <div>
 <ul>
  <li>Experience in creating detailed reports, maintaining quality records, and documenting test results to ensure traceability, accuracy and compliance documentation of progress</li>
  <li>Assisted in process control and improvement, identifying areas to enhance efficiency and
productivity</li>
  <li>Gained hands-on experience with chemical editors such as Marvin, ChemDraw, and BioviaDraw for
chemical structure modeling and documentation.</li>
  <li>Followed GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) standards, ensuring all processes met regulatory
requirements</li>
<li>Adhered to laboratory safety standards, maintaining a safe and compliant work environment.</li>
<li>Performed a variety of chemical laboratory techniques, including titration, chromatography, and
spectroscopy and skilled in thermal analysis, allowing for accurate and reliable quality assessments.</li>
 </ul> </div> </div>

<h2>High School</h2>
